### Pull Request Workflow
This workflow is required for the Group project.

1. Create a branch named for the feature you are working on
* Write Code
* Commit your code and write a [good commit message](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message)
* Push your branch and changes to your Github repository
* Create a Pull Request to your cohort organization

### Code Review Workflow

1. Another team mate reviews the pull request and writes code comments on Github
2. You make the desired changes (using the [Pull Request Workflow](#pull-request-workflow))
3. Repeat #1-2 until teammate has no more changes that need to be made

**Team should choose who merges Pull requests: code writer or the reviewer.**
